## 🎮 About the Game

You awaken inside a forgotten psychiatric hospital. You're not sure who you are... or why you're here. But the place is watching you.  
As you explore the empty halls, interact with eerie objects, and confront terrifying memories, the truth begins to unfold —  
You were never just a patient.

> 🩸 *"The monster they feared wasn’t in the dark. It was always inside me."*
